# Sales-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-Excel-
# 🧾 Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project is a personal data analytics portfolio project aimed at demonstrating key data skills across cleaning, transformation, KPI extraction, and dashboard creation using both Python (Google Colab) and Excel. The dashboard visualizes key sales insights for strategic decision-making.

## 📁 Project Overview

The project explores Superstore sales data and answers the question:

> **Which products, customer segments, categories, and regions should be targeted or avoided to improve profitability and sales performance?**

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Excel** (Pivot Tables, Power Query, Slicers, Charts, Dashboarding)
- **Python** (via Google Colab for data cleaning and transformation using Pandas)
- **Power Query** (for type casting, checking nulls, and refining structure)

---

## 📌 Key Processes

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Loaded raw Excel data into Google Colab
- Cleaned inconsistent formats (especially `Order Date` and `Ship Date`)
- Extracted and created **Order Year** and **Order Month** columns
- Removed duplicates and handled null values
- Exported cleaned dataset back to Excel

### 2. **Power Query in Excel**
- Rechecked for inconsistencies in data types and blanks
- Ensured all fields were clean and ready for analysis

### 3. **KPI Calculations**
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Profit Margin
- Number of Orders

### 4. **Pivot Table Analyses**
- **Product-Level Performance**
- **Category Trends**
- **Region Performance**
- **Customer Segment Insights**
- **Time-based Trends (by Year and Month)**

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard**
- Created an Excel-based Dashboard with:
  - KPI Cards
  - Slicers for filtering by Region, Year, and Segment
  - Charts for deep insights
  - Clean, professional design
